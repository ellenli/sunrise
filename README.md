*Before and after installing Sunrise.*

**Sunrise for Google Calendar** applies the clean and minimalist aesthetic of [Sunrise](http://blog.sunrise.am/post/90663314504/sunrise-for-mac) (now discontinued) to Google Calendar. The source code is here in this repo. If you spot any issues, reach out or [log an issue](https://github.com/ellenli/sunrise/issues/new). Feel free to fork/contribute!

Note: As of *October 29, 2017*, this extension also supports [the redesigned Google Calendar](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16488438/google-calendar-web-redesign-update) but there's lots still to come. See [the backlog](https://github.com/ellenli/sunrise/issues/) to see what's up next!

Install the latest version via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sunrise-for-google-calend/fmjolpmacffkcohajfojifclfhcignem). :wave:
